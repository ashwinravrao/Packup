# Boxray Packing Organizer

Android app that helps users manage their packed boxes and items during a move. Digital boxes can be created, filled, documented and tracked. This app is being built using Room, LiveData, Data Binding and more. It consumes Google Maps API, follows MVVM architecture pattern, and uses AndroidX libraries. A rewrite to Kotlin is planned.
