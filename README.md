# Locrate Moving Manager

Know what's inside your boxes during a move. Simply snap a photo of each item as you pack. When you're at your new home, scan the number written on the side of your box and see a gallery of items without ever having to cut any tape.

Locrate Moving Manager is built using some of the latest libraries and frameworks, including:

- MVVM
- Room
- Glide
- CameraX
- Dagger 2
- Data binding
- and Android Jetpack
