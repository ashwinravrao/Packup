With Packup for Android you can conveniently keep track of boxes and their contents during a move. Moving can be stressful, especially when you want to find something but can't remember where you put it. While packing, simply snap a photo of each item, give it a name and an optional value. You can also register an NFC sticker for each box so that your packing list is just a tap away. Simply select the NFC registration option when adding a box and tap your sticker to the back of your phone. Stick it onto the outside of your box. When searching for an item, open the app and tap your device on the tag. The app also supports text search on items, descriptions, names, and box numbers.
