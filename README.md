# Locrate Packing Utility

Locrate is a convenient system for keeping track of your box contents during a move. Simply snap a photo of each item as you pack, and label your boxes using the auto generated id numbers. At your new home, scan the side of a box and instantly see a gallery of items inside. Unlike with other apps that rely on bar/QR codes that need to be printed and can fall off, Locrate uses machine learning to recognize hand-written labels! 

Locrate is built using some of the latest libraries and frameworks, including:

- MVVM
- Room
- Glide
- CameraX
- Dagger 2
- Data binding
- and Android Jetpack
