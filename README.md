Packup and Move (Packup for short) is an app for conveniently keeping track of your boxes and their contents after a move. Moving can be stressful, especially when you want to find something but can't remember where you put it. While packing, simply snap a photo of every item with the built-in camera, label it with a name and value (optional), and you're done! Packup can also register NFC stickers so that your packing list is just a tap away. Simply select the NFC registration option when adding a box and tap your sticker to the back of your phone. Stick it onto the outside of your box. Whenever you want to know what's inside a box, simply open the app, tap your phone on the sticker, and a gallery of items will pop up! Packup supports text search on items, descriptions, names, and box numbers. You can search from the box list and inside a box. Try it by downloading the .apk file from the Releases tab above.

Packup and Move is built with the following libraries and tools:

 - MVVM architecture
 - Room for local storage
 - Glide for image loading
 - CameraX for the built-in viewfinder
 - Dagger2 dependency injection
 - Native data binding
 - Kotlin coroutines
