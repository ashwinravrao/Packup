# Locrate Packing Utility

Locrate is a convenient system for keeping track of your box contents during a move. Simply snap a photo of each item as you pack, and label your boxes using the auto generated id numbers. At your new home, tap the side of a box and instantly see a gallery of items inside. Unlike with other apps that rely on bar/QR codes that need to be printed and taped on, Locrate uses inexpensive NFC stickers that can be purchased in bulk and securely adhere to cardboard to make scanning easy.

Locrate is built using some of the latest libraries and frameworks, including:

- MVVM
- Room
- Glide
- CameraX
- Dagger 2
- Data binding
- and Android Jetpack
